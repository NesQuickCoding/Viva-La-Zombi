# Zombie Pew
This repo contains a simple side scrolling shooter game I developed through Python with the use of the pygame module. This project demonstrates the use of class and objects. This contains a scoreboard in the top middle portion to show how many points you acquired from shooting the zombie. The zombie contains a health bar that decreases the more you successfully shoot it.
